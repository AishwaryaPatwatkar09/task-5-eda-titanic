ðŸš¢ Titanic EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python. This project uncovers insights into passenger survival by examining key features such as age, gender, fare, and class through visualizations and statistics.

ðŸ“Š Key Features Analyzed
Gender vs Survival
Age Distribution
Class-based Survival
Fare vs Survival
Correlation Heatmap
Pairplot for multivariate patterns

ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used
Python 3
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ“ˆ Sample Visuals
Distribution plots (e.g., Age, Fare)
Count plots (e.g., Survival by Gender)
Boxplots and Heatmaps
Pairplots for multivariate comparison

ðŸ§  Key Insights
Women and children had higher survival rates.
First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
Higher fares correlated positively with survival chances.
Age played a lesser role compared to class and gender.

ðŸš€ Getting Started
